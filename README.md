2. **Search Functionality**

     - Validate the input (ensure it's not empty).
     - Fetch photos based on the query from the Pexels API.
     - Display the first photo result.
     - Display similar photos in the carousel.

3. **Display First Result**
   - Set the source and alt attributes of the first result image.
   - Attach an event listener to the "Show Author Details" button to open a modal with the author details.

4. **Display Similar Results**
   - Iterate over the fetched photos.
   - Create a carousel slide for each photo, including a heart button.
   - Attach event listeners to the heart buttons to handle adding/removing photos from the wishlist.

5. **Add to Wishlist**
   - When a photo is added to the wishlist:
     - Remove the photo from the carousel.
     - Append the photo to the wishlist container.
     - Attach an event listener to the heart button to handle removal from the wishlist.

6. **Remove from Wishlist**
   - When a photo is removed from the wishlist:
     - Remove the photo from the wishlist container.
     - Re-add the photo to the carousel with the appropriate event listener.

7. **Open Modal**
   - When the "Show Author Details" button is clicked:
     - Populate the modal with the photographerâ€™s name and image.
     - Display the modal.
     - Attach event listeners to close the modal when the close button is clicked or when the user clicks outside the modal.

### Responsive Design
